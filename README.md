   * Dataset Features:
   
        Survival: Passenger Survival Status
        
         0 = No (the passenger is not survival) , 1 = Yes (the passenger is survival)
        
        Pclass: Passenger Socioeconomic Status
        
         1st = Upper Level, 2nd = Middle Level, 3rd = Lower Level

         male, female
                
        Age: Passenger Age
        
        ```
        Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
        ```
            
        Sibsp: number of Sibling and Spouse
        
         Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
