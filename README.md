# Titanic-Kaggle

#### Purpose:

This project is to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. 

#### 1.1 Data Extraction
    
   * The Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is from kaggle:
   
        https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data
        
   * Dataset Features:
   
        Survival: Passenger Survival Status
        
         0 = No (the passenger is not survival) , 1 = Yes (the passenger is survival)
        
        Pclass: Passenger Socioeconomic Status
        
         1st = Upper Level, 2nd = Middle Level, 3rd = Lower Level
         
        Sex: Passenger Gender
        
         male, female
                
        Age: Passenger Age
        
         Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

        sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
        
        Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
        
        Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

        parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
        
        Parent = mother, father
        
        Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
        
        Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them
